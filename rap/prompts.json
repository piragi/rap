When the original question is answerable, please start the subquestion with \"Now we can answer the question: \".\nQuestion 1: Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice as 30 years old, how old is Kody?\nQuestion 1.1: How old is Mohamed?\nAnswer 1.1: He is currently 30 * 2 = 60 years old. The answer is 60.\nQuestion 1.2: How old was Mohamed four years ago?\nAnswer 1.2: Four years ago, he must have been 60 - 4 = 56 years old. The answer is 56.\nQuestion 1.3: How old was Kody four years ago?\nAnswer 1.3: Kody was half as old as Mohamed four years ago. Thus, Kody was 56 / 2 = 28 years old. The answer is 28.\nQuestion 1.4: Now we can answer the question: How old is Kody?\nAnswer 1.4: She is currently 28 + 4 = 32 years old. The answer is 32.\n\nQuestion 2: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze. They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies before two of the fireflies flew away. How many fireflies remained?\nQuestion 2.1: How many fireflies joined?\nAnswer 2.1: The fireflies were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, which are 12 - 4 = 8 fireflies. The answer is 8.\nQuestion 2.2: Now we can answer the question: How many fireflies remained?\nAnswer 2.2: Three fireflies were dancing originally. They were joined by 8 fireflies before two of them flew away. So there were 3 + 8 - 2 = 9 remaining. The answer is 9.\n\nQuestion 3: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.\nQuestion 3.1: How much money does Ali have in total?\nAnswer 3.1: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So he has 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = 160 dollars. The answer is 160.\nQuestion 3.2: How much money does Ali give to his sister?\nAnswer 3.2: Ali gives half of the total money he has to his sister. So he gives 160 / 2 = 80 dollars to his sister. The answer is 80.\nQuestion 3.3: How much money does Ali have after giving his sister the money?\nAnswer 3.3: After giving his sister the money, Ali has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. The answer is 80.\nQuestion 3.4: How much money does Ali use to buy dinner?\nAnswer 3.4: Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. So he uses 80 * 3/5 = 48 dollars to buy dinner. The answer is 48.\nQuestion 3.5: Now we can answer the question: How much money does Ali have after buying the dinner?\nAnswer 3.5: After buying the dinner, Ali has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left. The answer is 32.\n\nQuestion 4: A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nQuestion 4.1: How far did the car travel except for the 3rd turn?\nAnswer 4.1: It travels 5 meters after the 1st, 8 meters after the 2nd, and 0 meters after the 4th turn. It’s a total of 5 + 8 + 0 = 13 meters. The answer is 13.\nQuestion 4.2: Now we can answer the question: How far did the car have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nAnswer 4.2: The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. It travels 13 meters except for the 3rd turn. So it has to travel 23 - 13 = 10 meters after the 3rd turn. The answer is 10."

Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.\nQuestion: How much money does Ali have in total?\nAnswer: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So he has 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = 160 dollars. The answer is 160.\nQuestion: How much money does Ali give to his sister?\nAnswer: Ali gives half of the total money he has to his sister. So he gives 160 / 2 = 80 dollars to his sister. The answer is 80.\nQuestion: How much money does Ali have after giving his sister the money?\nAnswer: After giving his sister the money, Ali has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. The answer is 80.\nQuestion: How much money does Ali use to buy dinner?\nAnswer: Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. So he uses 80 * 3/5 = 48 dollars to buy dinner. The answer is 48.\nQuestion: Now we can answer the question: How much money does Ali have after buying the dinner?\nAnswer: After buying the dinner, Ali has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left. The answer is 32.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nGiven a question, please decompose it into sub-questions.

After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nQuestion: How far did the car travel except for the 3rd turn?\nAnswer: It travels 5 meters after the 1st, 8 meters after the 2nd, and 0 meters after the 4th turn. It’s a total of 5 + 8 + 0 = 13 meters. The answer is 13.\nQuestion: Now we can answer the question: How far did the car have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nAnswer: The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. It travels 13 meters except for the 3rd turn. So it has to travel 23 - 13 = 10 meters after the 3rd turn. The answer is 10.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nGiven a question, please decompose it into sub-questions.
